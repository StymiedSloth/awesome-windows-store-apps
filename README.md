Well designed and great Windows Store apps

## Note taking and Markdown apps
### Top Picks
* [Appy Text](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH51KNM) - A terrific alternative to notepad and is capable of markdown. This list was written on App Text.
* [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFHVJL) - Grand daddy of note taking apps. Chock-full of features like inking, screen and web grabs etc.
* [Evernote](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFJ3MB) - Comparable to Onenote and provides a lot of features . It's not as well designed and is a more expensive option.

### Honorable mentions
* [Nebo](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH4NLB0) - Well made, but seems to be a port of the iPad app, so the UX is a bit jarring in some places.

## Todo Apps
### Top Picks
* [Myerlist](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH11K1M) - A clean and simple todo app. Meant to get the job done without much distraction. Windows and Android only for now.
* [Wunderlist](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRDFXZS) - The best Todo app in the store in terms of features. Also gets bonus points for being cross platform. Is going to be replaced my Microsoft ToDo, but that day is not here yet.
* [Todo Prime](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFHZZQ) - A feature rich todo app that is clean and responsive. Developer states support for Windows Phone but I am not sure how long that'll last :( .

### Honorable Mentions
* [Microsoft Todo](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH5R558) - Will replace Wunderlist some day. It's well designed and is cross platform. Needs more UX tweaks to make it into the top picks.

## Utilties
* [8Zip](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFHWB8) - Archiving utility app that supports all major compression standards and is well designed. All the old compression apps that scale terribly should be a thing of the past once you use this app.
* [Torrex](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRDSGKG) - The best torrent app in the Windows Store. Wide range of Microsoft devices supported.
* [Quicklook](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NV4BS3L1H4S) - get macOS like quick preview functionality when higlighting a file.
